# 1. Follow Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines
You must follow Discord's TOS and Community Guidelines. Failure to comply may result in a ban from our server and possibly from Discord itself.

## 1.1 Age Requirement
You must be at least 13 years old to use Discord. Claiming to be younger, even as a joke, will result in a ban.

## 1.2 No Leaking Private Information
Private information, including but not limited to IP addresses, physical addresses, phone numbers, legal names, or government-issued IDs, is strictly prohibited on the server. Any other identifiable information is also not allowed.

## 1.3 No Recording Voice Channels
Recording voice channels without consent is not permitted. You must obtain consent from everyone in the voice channel before recording.
> Exception: Stages hosted by Directors are exempt from this rule.

# 2. Be Respectful to All Members
We have zero tolerance for any form of hate speech, including racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. Comments or jokes that resemble hate speech will be punished accordingly.

## 2.1 Avoid Sensitive Topics
Respect everyone’s opinions. If a discussion on a sensitive topic leads to drama, moderative actions will be taken. Examples of sensitive topics include: politics, religion, sexuality, gender, and war.

## 2.2 No Spamming / Being a Nuisance
Spamming any form of media, including emotes and reactions, is prohibited. Spamming also includes pinging people without a valid reason, excessive use of soundboards, screaming in voice channels, excessive posting in forum channels, and creating numerous tickets in a short period of time.

## 2.3 Do Not Be Annoying
There is no clear definition of "annoying." If multiple people express irritation with you, you may be the issue. Find a different topic to discuss.

## 2.4 No Mini-Modding
Mini-modding (or backseat moderating) is when you correct someone’s behavior without being a moderator. If you believe someone is breaking the rules, use our ticket system to report them.

## 2.5 Do Not Bypass Automod
If your message is blocked by the automod, do not attempt to bypass it.

## 2.6 English Only
While we have channels for theme parks in other countries, please use English only.

## 2.7 Discord Profiles
Discord profiles, including statuses and nicknames, must adhere to server rules. Impersonation of others is not allowed.

# 3. No Advertising
Advertising of any kind, including direct message (DM) advertising, is not permitted.

# 4. Moderators and Directors Have the Final Say
Moderators and Directors have the final say and can issue punishments for reasons not stated here. Some punishments may be delayed due to moderator availability.

Please do not argue with moderators about punishments within the server or discuss punishments from other servers. If you need to discuss anything, please open a support ticket here: [Support Ticket](https://discord.com/channels/1280213783142203514/1280253851122929757)
